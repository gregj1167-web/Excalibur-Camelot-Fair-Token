Excalibur $EXS Protocol - Universal Batched/Fused Tetra-PoW & Dice Mining Kernel

This module provides an optimized batched and fused bit-sliced kernel for mining operations.
It improves speed, modularity, and maintainability by processing multiple hashes simultaneously
with easy fusion composition.

Key Features:
- Batched hash computation: Process multiple nonces in parallel
- Fused operations: Combine multiple hash functions efficiently
- Bit-sliced operations: Optimize bitwise operations across batches
- Universal fusion: Easy composition of different hash algorithms
- Modular design: Reusable components for all mining workflows

Performance Benefits:
- Reduced function call overhead through batching
- Better CPU cache utilization with contiguous data
- Vectorization opportunities for SIMD operations
- Shared computation across multiple hashes
