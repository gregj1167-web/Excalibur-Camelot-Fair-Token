## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy to Digital Ocean

Since everything is already configured, you can proceed with deployment:

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Create Digital Ocean Droplet** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
2. **Point DNS** to your droplet IP:
   ```
   Type    Name    Value
   A       @       YOUR_DROPLET_IP
   A       www     YOUR_DROPLET_IP
   ```
3. **SSH into server** and run:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Holedozer1229/Excalibur-EXS/main/scripts/quick-deploy-digitalocean.sh | sudo bash

## 🎯 Important Notes

### No Code Changes Needed ✅
Your repository is already properly configured. All you need to do is:
1. Deploy to Digital Ocean
2. Configure DNS
3. The scripts will handle the rest!

### All Links Are Relative ✅
The website uses relative paths like:
- `/web/knights-round-table/` - Works on any domain
- `/admin/merlins-portal/` - Works on any domain
- `assets/css/main.css` - Relative to page location

This means the site will work correctly once deployed to www.excaliburcrypto.com without any modifications.

### Mobile Apps Ready ✅
Your React Native mobile apps are already configured to point to:
- `https://www.excaliburcrypto.com/web/knights-round-table/`
- `https://www.excaliburcrypto.com/admin/merlins-portal/`

Just rebuild them after deployment:
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm install
npm run ios      # For iOS
npm run android  # For Android
```
