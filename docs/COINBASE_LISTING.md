# 🗡️ Excalibur $EXS: Coinbase Listing Documentation

## Executive Summary

**Excalibur $EXS** is a deterministic quantum vault protocol built on the Bitcoin Ambiguity Fork, implementing a fair-launch tokenomics model through the **Ω′ Δ18 Tetra-PoW** proof-of-work mechanism. This document provides the technical and legal framework required for exchange listing compliance.

## Technical Overview

### Protocol Architecture

**Token Standard:** Bitcoin Runes  
**Consensus Mechanism:** Proof-of-Forge (PoF)  
**Derivation:** BIP-86 (Taproot)  
**Key Stretching:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (600,000 iterations)  
**Mining Algorithm:** Ω′ Δ18 Tetra-PoW (128 rounds)

### Tokenomics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Max Supply** | 21,000,000 $EXS |
| **Decimals** | 8 |
| **Reward per Forge** | 100 $EXS |
| **Forge Fee** | 10,000 satoshis |
| **Distribution Model** | Proof-of-Forge based |

### Distribution Breakdown

- **Proof-of-Forge (PoF):** 60% (12,600,000 $EXS)
  - Distributed to users who successfully complete Ω′ Δ18 proofs
  - Fair launch mechanism with no pre-mine
  
- **Treasury:** 15% (3,150,000 $EXS)
  - Protocol development and maintenance
  - Security audits and bug bounties
  
- **Liquidity:** 20% (4,200,000 $EXS)
  - DEX and CEX liquidity provision
  - Market making operations
  
- **Airdrop:** 5% (1,050,000 $EXS)
  - Community incentives
  - Early adopter rewards

## Fair Launch Mechanism

### Proof-of-Work Validation

The $EXS protocol ensures fair distribution through the **Ω′ Δ18 Tetra-PoW** mechanism:

1. **Deterministic Generation:** Each token claim requires a valid cryptographic proof
2. **Difficulty Target:** 4 leading zeros in the proof hash (adjustable)
3. **No Pre-Mine:** All tokens are minted through the forge process
4. **Transparent Distribution:** All claims recorded in `ledger/claims.json`

### Axiom Seed

**Public Axiom:**
```
sword legend pull magic kingdom artist stone destroy forget fire steel honey question
```

This 13-word axiom serves as the entropy source for:
- Taproot address derivation (BIP-86)
- Quantum-hardened key generation (HPP-1)
- Deterministic vault creation

**Security Properties:**
- 600,000 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 iterations
- 128-round unrolled nonlinear state shifts
- Quantum-resistant entropy stretching

## Rosetta API Integration

The $EXS protocol implements the **Rosetta Construction API** standard for exchange integration.

### Supported Operations

1. **TRANSFER:** Standard token transfers between Taproot addresses
2. **FORGE:** Mining operation that generates new $EXS tokens
3. **REWARD_TRANSACTION:** Distribution of forge rewards (exchange transparency)
4. **FEE:** Transaction fee operations

### Configuration

See `rosetta-exs.yaml` for complete Rosetta API specification including:
- Network identifiers
- Currency metadata
- Operation types and statuses
- Error codes
- Construction API endpoints

## Smart Contract Audit

### Treasury Contract

**Location:** `pkg/economy/treasury.go`

**Key Functions:**
- `RecordForge`: Tracks forging fees sent to treasury
- `ClaimReward`: Validates Ω′ Δ18 proofs and distributes rewards
- `GetTreasuryStats`: Returns real-time treasury metrics

**Security Features:**
- Max supply enforcement
- Proof verification (4 leading zeros)
- Double-claim prevention
- Atomic reward distribution

### Tokenomics Contract

**Location:** `pkg/economy/tokenomics.json`

Immutable parameters defining:
- Maximum token supply
- Reward distribution per forge
- Fee structure
- Distribution percentages
