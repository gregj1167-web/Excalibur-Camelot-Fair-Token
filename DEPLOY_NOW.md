## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create Digital Ocean Droplet (5 min)

1. Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com
2. Click **Create** → **Droplets**
3. Select:
   - **Image**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - **Plan**: $24/month (4GB RAM recommended)
   - **Datacenter**: Closest to your users
4. Add SSH key or password
5. Click **Create Droplet**
6. **Note your IP address** (e.g., 123.45.67.89)

### Step 2: Point Your Domain (10 min)

Go to your domain registrar and add DNS records:

```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       YOUR_DROPLET_IP
A       www     YOUR_DROPLET_IP
```

**Wait 5-15 minutes for DNS to propagate**

Verify with: `dig www.excaliburcrypto.com`

### Step 3: Deploy (5 min)

SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP
```

Run the one-command deployment:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Holedozer1229/Excalibur-EXS/main/scripts/quick-deploy-digitalocean.sh | sudo bash
```

That's it! The script will:
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Deploy your website
- ✅ Configure Nginx
- ✅ Setup firewall
- ✅ Install SSL certificate
- ✅ Secure admin portal

# Quick tests
curl -I https://www.excaliburcrypto.com
curl -I https://www.excaliburcrypto.com/web/knights-round-table/
curl -I https://www.excaliburcrypto.com/admin/merlins-portal/
```

Expected results:
- Main site: `HTTP/2 200`
- Knights portal: `HTTP/2 200`
- Admin portal: `HTTP/2 401` (auth required)
